Univariate Linear Regression using sklearn on Diabetes Dataset

Univariate Linear Regression uses one dependent variable and one independent variable.

Dependent Variable - This is the variable that is going to be predicted.

Independent Variable - This is the data that is being used in order to make the prediction.

Univariate Linear Regression Formula

y = mx + c

y - dependent variable

x - independent variable (It is a single variable for univariate linear regression but for multivariate Linear regression there could be many x1,x2,x3 etc)

c - this is a constant
